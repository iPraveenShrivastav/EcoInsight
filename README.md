## 🚨 The Problem

Every day, millions of people shop without knowing the full impact of the products they buy:

- ❓ Is this food actually healthy?
- ⚠️ Does it contain hidden allergens?
- 🌍 How much harm does it cause the environment?

Shoppers want to take control of their health and reduce their footprint — but this information is either hard to find, misleading, or missing entirely at the point of decision.
